# TEST PM PARTNERS

This is what I was able to do yesterday before leaving the office.

Those files concern the first question (Q1) except for the "sorting.js" file which contains the code for the bubble sorting.

You can run the following script to launch the project (Q1) : 

`npm run dev`

You can run the following command to see the result of the bubble sorting algorithm : 

`node sorting.js`
